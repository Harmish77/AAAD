Android Auto Apps Downloader (AAAD) is an app for Android Phones that downloads popular Android Auto 3rd party apps and installs them in the correct way to have them in Android Auto. 

For the first time in 3 years, now users with **non-rooted Android devices** can enjoy these apps made for Android Auto, and Android Auto Apps Downloader does it all for you. Simply select an app you want to install on your phone and the download will begin. Once completed, install the given app with the classic Android interface and you can start enjoying the app you’ve just downloaded on Android Auto.

### No need for a PC. 

Android Auto Apps Downloader can be easily installed on any Android phone and the whole installing process is just on the phone.

### No need for developer options.

There’s this common misconception that enabling “unknown sources” or “disable ANR” make those apps work. I don’t know who started this, but it’s totally irrelevant. Debug USB? No need for that either.

### No need of grabbing APK and do manual installations.

Android Auto Apps Downloader will always download the latest version of the software for you. 

### No root needed.

The main goal of this app is having the listed apps in Android Auto with a pain free experience and, most of all, without requiring a rooted phone. If you are rooted, you might want to consider [AA AIO TWEAKER](https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker), which has an alternative root method to patch the apps and it has a lot of other cool features!

Android Auto Apps Downloader is free and offers in app purchases. The free version of the app allows up to 10 download every 1 days. With the PRO version you can enjoy the full experience and download as many times as you want, forever!

# F.A.Q.

### Why the heck do I need this app? Can’t I just install the apps by myslef?

Well yes, you could, but they would not appear in Android Auto. Since the beginning of 2018 the custom apps for Android Auto are blocked by Google, but AAAD installs them in a special way in order to actually see the apps on Android Auto. And no root is needed! Call it magic, if you will.

### I have a warning from Google Play Protect warning me about your app! Is this app a malware?

Of course AAAD it’s not a malware. Google Play Store does not like apps that install other apps and apps that have IAP (in app purchases) not managed by Google. You can see yourself that this app basically doesn’t require special permissions. Also, I’m planning on releasing the source code soon! 

### Why only those apps? Where is YouTube? Where is Netflix? Where is Instagram?

Not all apps are compatible with Android Auto. You can’t just pick an app and sledge hammer it into Android Auto. I’ve included basically almost every Android Auto app known to date, and the only responsibility of AAAD is to make them available in Android Auto. 

### How do I update the apps installed from AAAD?

AAAD will always download latest version of an app. If one of the apps that you've installed through AAAD gets an update, you can open AAAD and download the update. At the moment, there's no update checker, but I'm planning on making it! 

### Will you hold my bank account/credit card informations?

No. All the details of payment are held by Stripe Inc. and not processed nor passed to myself in any way. Also, I don't really care. 

### Will this app be available on the Play Store?

No.

### I have a problem with an app installed by AAAD. Could you help me out?

Any software installed by my app is provided "as is" and I'm not responsible for any malfunctioning. If you are in this case, please seek help from the software's author instead. 

### I have a problem with this app. Could you help me out?

Contact us through the app! Open the top right menu and select "Help".

### Sir how do I download this app????

If you are on mobile, you likely will have a little dropdown menu named "Assets", from there you can see the package (APK) to install the app. Download and install. If you are on a PC, you might see the "Assets" menu already collapsed and from there you can see the APK.

### I can't pay for AAAD pro because my card is not supported. How can I pay for PRO?

Please write to help.aaad@gmail.com with subject including "NOPP" 

### How long will my PRO license last?

There's no expiration date to PRO version of AAAD, but keep in mind that once you purchase a license it is bond to that device. An active license can be transferred autonomously with the function "Transfer license" available in the app's menu. If you are having difficulties retrieving your PRO license after a factory reset, please [contact us](mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=PROWIPED&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0Amy%20AAAD's%20license%20was%20lost%20after%20a%20device%20reset.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe%20e-mail%20I've%20used%20for%20the%20payment%20is%0D%0A%0D%0AThank%20you) with the same device.
